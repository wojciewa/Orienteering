An application that calculates the current distance between two points.
Repeatedly during orienteering, I encountered the problem of measuring the distance between two points - for example, at the start, I knew from the map that I had to run 260 meters to the left turn. Instead of counting this in my head, the watch could do it for me, but since I couldn't find the right application, I wrote my own.

The activity starts, of course, by selecting the Start option from the menu; Pressing the LAP button resets the top counter. To save the activity, simply select Stop from the menu. Exit the application by pressing the DOWN button.

The application is for the Garmin Fenix3 watch (because that's the one I have), but it may also work on others. Have fun!
